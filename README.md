# compliance-incident-issues

Template repository to clone compliance-incident-issues for reference compliance toolchain templates.

## Purpose of this repository

This repository serves as an incident issue board for reference compliance toolchain templates.

In case of multiple services under one organization or application, or multiple ci/cd pipelines, it is good to have a single repository to collect compliance incident issues from all services.

This repo can be replaced with a single microservice repo, the same that holds the code itself, so incidents will be recorded to the issues of that repo.
