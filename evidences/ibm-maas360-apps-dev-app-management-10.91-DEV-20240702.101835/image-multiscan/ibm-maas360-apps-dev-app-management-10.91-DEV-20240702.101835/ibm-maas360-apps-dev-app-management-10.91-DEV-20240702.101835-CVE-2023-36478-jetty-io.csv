In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15\, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15\, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52\, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit\, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However\, when length is very large and huffman is true\, the multiplication by 4 in line 295 will overflow\, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative\, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore\, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative\, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or\, more precisely\, a length value which\, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor\, is negative)\, and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2\, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16\, 10.0.16\, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.","high","9.4.39.v20210325","11.0.16","2023-10-10",,"jetty-io","jar","/opt/tomcat/webapps/app-management.war/ehcache-2.10.9.2.jar","high - twistlock","7.5 - twistlock","7.5",,,,,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",,"45","13","false",,"twistlock","nvd-status(awaiting analysis)"
