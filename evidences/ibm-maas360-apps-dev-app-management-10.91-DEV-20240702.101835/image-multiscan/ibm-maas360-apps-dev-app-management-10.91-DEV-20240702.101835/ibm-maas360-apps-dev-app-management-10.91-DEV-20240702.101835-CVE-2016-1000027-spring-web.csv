Depending on how the library is implemented within a product\, this issue may or not occur\, and authentication may be required. NOTE: the vendor\\'s position is that untrusted data is not an intended use case. The product\\'s behavior will not be changed because some users rely on deserialization of trusted data.","critical","5.3.34","6.0.0","2020-01-02",,"spring-web","jar","/opt/tomcat/webapps/app-management.war/spring-web-5.3.34.jar","critical - twistlock","9.8 - twistlock","9.8",,,,,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H",,"45","13","false",,"twistlock","nvd-status(modified)"
