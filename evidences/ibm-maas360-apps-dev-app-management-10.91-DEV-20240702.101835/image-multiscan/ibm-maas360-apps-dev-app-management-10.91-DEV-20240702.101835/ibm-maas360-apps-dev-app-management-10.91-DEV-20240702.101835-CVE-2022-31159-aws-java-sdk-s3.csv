A partial-path traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of the AWS SDK for Java v1 prior to version 1.12.261. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument\, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under certain conditions\, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory. This issueâ€™s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`\, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`\, but not `/tmp/bar`. If `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an untrusted buckets contents\, the contents of that bucket can be written outside of the intended destination directory. Version 1.12.261 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround\, when calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDi","high","1.11.986","1.12.261","2022-07-15",,"aws-java-sdk-s3","jar","/opt/tomcat/webapps/app-management.war/aws-java-sdk-s3-1.11.986.jar","high - twistlock","7.9 - twistlock","7.9",,,,,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N",,"45","13","false",,"twistlock","nvd-status(analyzed)"
