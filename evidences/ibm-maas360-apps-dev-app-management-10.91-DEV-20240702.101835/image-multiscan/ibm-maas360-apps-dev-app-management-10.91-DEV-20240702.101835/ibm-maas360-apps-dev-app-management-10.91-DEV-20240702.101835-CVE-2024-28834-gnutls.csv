The Minerva attack is a cryptographic vulnerability that exploits deterministic behavior in systems like GnuTLS\, leading to side-channel leaks. In specific scenarios\, such as when using the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_REPRODUCIBLE flag\, it can result in a noticeable step in nonce size from 513 to 512 bits\, exposing a potential timing side-channel.","medium","3.6.16-8.el8_9.1","3.6.16-8.el8_9.3","2024-03-21",,"gnutls","os",,"medium - twistlock","5.3 - twistlock","5.3",,,,,,,"22","0","true",,"twistlock","nvd-status(awaiting analysis)"
