In its API\, an application creates 'easy handles' that are the individual handles for single transfers.  libcurl provides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called [curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).  If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated\, the cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on disk\, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name as `none` (using the four ASCII letters\, no quotes).  Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named `none` - if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory of the program using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.
