This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is (expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST.","low","7.61.1-33.el8","7.61.1-33.el8_9.5","2023-05-26",,"libcurl","os",,"low - twistlock","3.7 - twistlock","3.7",,,,,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N",,"22","0","true",,"twistlock","nvd-status(undergoing analysis)"
