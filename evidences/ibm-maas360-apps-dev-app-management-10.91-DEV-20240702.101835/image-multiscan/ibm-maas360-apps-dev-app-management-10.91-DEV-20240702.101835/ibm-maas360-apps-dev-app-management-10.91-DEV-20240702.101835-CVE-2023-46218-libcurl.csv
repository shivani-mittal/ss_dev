This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to different and unrelated sites and domains.  It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl\\'s function that verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`\, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.
